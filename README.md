<h1 align="center" id="title">Notion And Finance Project</h1>

The Notion is a new era for a workspace üìë where you can think, write, and plan. When you use it, you will see a simple user interface and you don‚Äôt need anything. Just click the button and discover an amazing world üëª. In this way, you can increase your personal efficiency ‚è±, and improve your memory with Notion. I am using it for daily notes, saving websites, recording codes, and creating a deadline for my projects. For this reason, I developed a project in Notion with Python. I specifically focus on database uploading and downloading steps in Python. For visualization, I used a Notion. Also, this project includes javascript codes. So, if you don't know about javascript you can watch these videos.
